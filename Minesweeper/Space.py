		*x_loc* = Integer location on the board. 0 is the left hand side.

		*y_loc* = Integer location on the board. 0 is the top of the board.
		
		*isMine* = Boolean that logs if the space has a mine. True if it does, false otherwise.

		*isFlagged* = Boolean that logs if the user placed a flag on this space. True if the user did.

		*IsRevealed* = Boolean that logs if the contents of the space are revealed to the user. True if the user should see the contents.

		*numOfSurroundingMines* = Integer that tracks how many spaces in the 8 closest spaces have mines."""
